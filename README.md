# JS "I Am A Monkey"
Funny and explosive ways to `alert("i am a monkey")` in JavaScript with obfuscation

# About
Just a small and simple conpilation of obfuscations of the code `alert("i am a monkey")`

# Contributing
If you would like to add some obfuscated code, just make a pull request, but please make sure you are not submitting code that is already in this repository.

# How It Works
Some obfuscated code, like [JSFuck](http://www.jsfuck.com) uses "the atomic parts of JavaScript" which you can read more about at their website.

The other more generic obfuscated code simply uses really random variables and the memory addresses instead of the actual variables themselves. Many also encode strings and use unnecessarily long ways to do something simple.

Other ones, like [`emoticons.js`](https://github.com/ThePeeps191/js-i-am-a-monkey/blob/main/emoticons.js) — which was encoded with [aaencode](https://utf-8.jp/public/aaencode.html) — abuses UTF-8 characters making code really confusing and hard to read.

# Why I Did This
I was bored.
